This is a project from the university, we were a group of 5, but 2 of the group members left university before starting the project.

So we were left with a project thought for 5 people, as a 3 member team, so there are some unfinished things.

The index.html is on the public/info folders.

I made the general design of the site,logo, animation details, as well as choosing the color pallet. (public/info/index.hml dictated the general design)

The scope of the project had a around 100 use cases, but because of the circumstances previously mentioned, we ended up getting a reduced amount for a total of 49.
You can see the ones i ended up making here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1znGZ46kdIyFw9WrI47_t_cgWXxoGIFGi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102169957968380883439&rtpof=true&sd=true , they are the ones in color green, with this you can see what code is mine.
